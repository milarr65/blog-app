        <p>
          This project is an assignment from the online course{' '}
          <em>"The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp"</em> led by Angela Yu. We were
          given full creative control and no starting code.

          I decided to make this with React and Tailwind CSS since I hadn't really built a proper
          project with these tools before. I had a lot of fun. üòÖ I used a Tailwind plugin called{' '}

          to style everything. I definitely recommend it; it's pretty good and has many options
          available.

          as my rich text editor. This one was a challenge not gonna lie haha~ I had a hard time
          setting it up and getting it to work the way I wanted. But at the end I got it to work
          (mostly üòÖ) and I'm so happy I powered through all of it.
